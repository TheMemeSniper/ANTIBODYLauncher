ANTIBODY Launcher is the Swiss Army Knife of any tomfoolery. It allows you to run scripts, download script packages, upload files through FTP, run forkbombs, and more.

# Important Notice

I am not responsible for any damage this program may cause. You know full damn well what launching a forkbomb on a school SMB file share means.

# Commands overview

As of now, ABL has 4 commands:

- Launch scripts
- Download scripts
- Upload files
- Utilites

There will be more to come in the future, but for now ABL's functionality is just barely enough for me to release it.

# Launch scripts

Launches a script of any language in `{ABLFOLDER}/user/scripts`.
What'd you think it did?

# Download scripts

Downloads and extracts a ZIP file from a remote server to `{ABLFOLDER}/user/scripts`.

# Upload files

Upload a file to an FTP server.

# Utilites
Utilites is a "catch-all" for scripts that *should* be embedded in ABL, but don't really have a general place. These are usually small programs that aren't worth making a dedicated script for or little jokes.

Currently utilities has the following options:

- Forkbomb
- Brick shell (Linux only)

ABL is FOSS. This means ABL should never be sold, traded, or rebranded to remove the author's signature with no additional significant changes.
